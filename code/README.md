# How to run the code
		The code requires following libraries to be installed before running: math, matplotlib

#	Steps:
		1. Input the values of intial positions.
		2. Enter the value of time.
		3. Enter the value of steering angle(alpha).
		4. Enter the drive speed omega.

#	Output:
		1. In the terminal window, the final position of the vehicle has been displayed(x, y, Φ).
			Note: The Φ value is in degree.
		2. In the popped up window, the plot for x coordinate versus y coordinate has been displayed.

	Examples from terminal window are given below:

#	Example-1:
		Enter initial x coordinate:-12
		Enter initial y coordinate:45
		Enter initial orientation(Φ in degree):42
		Enter time(seconds):2300
		Enter steering angle(alpha in degree):53
		Enter rotational speed omega(rad/s):4.2

#	Example-2:
		Enter initial x coordinate:-500
		Enter initial y coordinate:237
		Enter initial orientation(Φ in degree):-12
		Enter time(seconds):4317
		Enter steering angle(alpha in degree):39
		Enter rotational speed omega(rad/s):7.9

	The output for both of the examples are displayed in 'results' folder.
